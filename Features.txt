To begin using this spreadsheet, click the "Get Statement" button on worksheet "Key." Browse for a statement you 
downloaded from www.bankofamerica.com (accouts tab, select an account, the download button is just above the 
"$Amount" column) and open it. The relevant data will be extracted to worksheet "Data" (there may be a sample
statement included in worksheet "Data" - if that's the case, you can use that, or simply following the previous
instructions will write over it).

-TRANSACTIONS-

From here, click on any transaction on worksheet "Data" (column B) to create a keyword for that transaction and
similar transactions. For example, if one of your transactions is: CHECKCARD 0602 CAFE AGORA INC ATLANTA GA, a
good keyword is "CAFE AGORA." Every transaction with the exact phrase "Cafe Agora" will be assigned the 
category and subcategory you specify. The transactions will fill themselves out as you create keywords. Selecting
a transaction that already has an associated keyword will not allow you to edit that keyword - that is done in 
worksheet "key," explained later - instead, it allows you to customize that one, single transaction. This is 
helpful for transactions like ATM withdrawls so that you can specify what you spent that cash on.

-CHARTS-

Once all of your transactions are filled out, you are ready to visualize your history. Go to worksheet "Charts" to
see a breakdown of your finances. Currently, the only displayed functionality that is available is the sort 
button in the upper-left, and update button in the center, and the "past __ weeks/months" fields. Enter a number
in either field and update the chart to see only data in that time frame.

-EDITING-
Any editing of keywords, categories, and subcategories is done in worksheet "key." To edit a keyword click in any
of the four cells in the row with that keyword. To edit a category or subcategory, click it in the field to the
right.
