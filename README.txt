been implimented yet, so it is imperitive that you read features.txt.

-----------------------

This is a glorified excel spreadsheet w/VBA I made for several reasons:

1) I wanted to be able to visualize my spending habits without giving Quicken or mint.com my money/banking info
2) I wanted to be able to customize my visualizations at will rather than trusting Quicken or mint.com to know
   what's best for me
3) I wanted to practice designing UIs because UIs are cool and interesting shut up yes they are they're cool.
4) VBA ties Microsoft Office together really well and opens up the capability to quickly and conviniently automate 
   the most important things you need to automate in an office setting: the most repetitive and mundane tasks. 
   But VBA isn't sexy, so no one wants to use it. So I guess I need to use it, because I hate repetition more than
   most.

The code isn't commented because of a particular habit of mine for independent projects: I don't comment until I'm
well into the project to give myself an excuse to reread and understand the code in its entirety (at that point), 
and I comment while doing so; this is how I studied in school, and it has proven useful when coding. This project 
has reached that point, and so my next task is to comment.
